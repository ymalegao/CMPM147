				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>You are traversing a vast ocean, with different depths, and there are periodically islands spawning around you</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> I used noise to know which tiles were going to be island and which tiles would be water. I did not have to change the tile generation code for this. After the water was spawned, I used noise again to add some nice depth affect on the water, since that is how deep water is portrayed in pokemon. On the islands, I spawned palm trees, and then made it so that if you clicked it would make a ripple in the water. I also tried to add some autotiling logic once again, so that the island that interacted with water would have curves on it </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I think this world looks the best, and the islands spawn according to the world key as well. I think I mostly struggled with spawning and coloring the islands, but after the islands were intially spawned, I thought that I should implement autotiling, and it went really well. I think once the islands and water were set, that was the most diffucult part, after that it was just adding decorations. </p>

				<h2>Artistic Statemnt</h2>
				<p>
					Infinity:
						This world is vast ocean with islands scattered around. This extends into infinity in all directions. 
					Variation in Space:
						The water have a deeper and darker blue to indicate depth. The islands have palm trees and autotiling implemented
					Variation in Key:
						The world key determines the islands that spawn, and the water depth, it is used to control the noise
					Signs of Life:
						Clicking on the water will create a ripple in the water
