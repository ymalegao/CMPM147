				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>We are trying to generate and implement autotiling so we can automatically generate maps and dungeons. Users can edit the map from the ascii grid on the left</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>We first have a grid that is filled with one code, and that grid is populated and over written using noise and random to generate biomes. Once that is done, I implemented auto-tiling logic to make sure that the tile to tile connection would be smoother. To do this we used tile bitmasking and a look up table, that was manually filled out in order to provide the right tile in the right context. It was like Wave Collapse Function but a little easier. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>For me the hardest part was the look up table and understanding how everything worked considering the autotiling. I was stuck on how to generate biomes and then apply the auto tiler to that until I figured out that you had to layer the codes so that they would render on top of one another. Once I had figured that out, there were a few edge cases that had to be fixed, but other than that, I think working with noise and random is not the easiest task in the world, espcially since they are so random! My highs were figuring out the autotiling logic, making the clouds not spawn in the same spot over and over, which was happening because of the random seed that was set. </p>
			</div>

				<h2>Artistic Statemnt</h2>
				<p>Dungeon:
					A dungeon map that can be played as a 2d playformer, or as a top down. 
					Codes: _ is wall, and . is floor 
					Life: As time goes by, the jewels outside the dungeon will glow and wink at you

					Overworld:
					A map that can be probably only played as a top down.
					Codes: W is water, : is dirt, and _ is grass
					Life: As time goes by, the clouds will pass through the scene and the water will have a shimmering affect
