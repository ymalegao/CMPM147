				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I dont know why instance mode was not working for the piano this time, so I decided that I would just make different html pages since that was maybe less work than creating and changing instance variables </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I made three folders, with their own html page and then was able to link them to this.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I did not enjoy this assignment as much because I was stressed the whole time because there was a CSE 130 assignment due and this was due Sunday, so I was a little stressed. Like a lot stressed even. But it worked out, thank you for the extension! I am not really a big fan of making three smaller projects, I would rather focus on one big one and polish it. </p>
