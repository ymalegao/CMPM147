				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is a living Impressions generator that uses mutations to get to the best evaluted similarity score. YOU HAVE TO RELOAD SOMETIMES AFTER SWITCHING THE IMAGE, if it doesnt get the mutation in like 20-30 seconds please consider reloading</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>You are able to choose from 5 options of what photo you want, and in seconds the generator is able to render shapes that match the color of the spot where it renders the shapes. This is done by mapping the X and Y coordinate that is chosen for the shape, to the image, and then getting the color of the image on that spot. Once the first set of shapes are rendered, the mutations will continue to generate shapes that are closer and closer to the image that we started with, using a evolutionary algorithm that keeps a higher score</li>
                    
                </ol>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I think this assignment went pretty well, I was able to make all the images generally pass the squint test. One thing I havent figured out is that if you change the slide to 1% on an image, and then change that percent, then when we try and mutate that image, it does not mutate well and will not change its shape. So I just had to refresh for each time I messed with the slider when I wanted to switch images. Other than that, I was not aware of any flaws that I found during the process. I was able to polish the generator, so that most of the time it would match the original photo and pass a squint test </p>
