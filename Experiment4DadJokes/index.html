				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Took inspriration from the slides: There are no geometric tiles: Every location is instead occupied by floating text. You are trapped in an infinite space of dad jokes.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I started by removing the shape of all the tiles, and then using https://icanhazdadjoke.com/, I was able to compile a list of dad jokes. I decided that I would start off in an empty enviornment and then if you clicked, a new dad joke would spawn. Which dad joke spawned was determined by the world seed  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I think that this was least exciting infinite world, but it meets the basic requirments. I did this one first, so I was not really sure about how the infite world was set up, so I mostly struggled with understanding how everything is being spawned </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Artistic Statemnt</h2>
				<p>
					Infinity:
						This world is nothing, but dad jokes. You are trapped in an infinite space of dad jokes. The world key determines which dad joke spawns
					Variation in Space:
						The variation in space occurs by tiles being spawned in different colors, but by clicking you are able to spawn a new dad joke
					Variation in Key:
						the world key determines which dad joke spawns, and the color of the tiles
					Signs of Life:
						You have to click on the screen to spawn a dad joke, so the world is not alive until you interact with it
