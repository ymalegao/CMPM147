				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I was trying to imitate a patch of clovers, because anytime I go running in the woods, I start to see huge patches of these.
					I try and look fo a 4 leaf clover when I go, so try and find the hidden 4 leaf clover! 
				</p>

			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I realized that a clover is made up of hearts, so I first started by finding out how I could make a heart shape.
					I found out multiple code examples online, so I followed those. After that, I generated clovers by generating 3 hearts at a time with
				different rotations and colors, and then generated those clovers in rows </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I think the most difficult part for me was trying to work with the draw function, since it would constantly update.
					For example, when I was choosing the colors to be random, it kept changing the colors every frame it would reset. 
					When I was generating the clovers by rows, it would change the position of all the clovers generated, so none would be on the screen.
					So I think this was the low for me, but it was a high when I finally got it to work.
