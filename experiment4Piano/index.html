				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>P3 of infinity Worlds, This is a piano that extends east forver. Changing the world key makes the keys play different chords</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I had to edit the engine.js to spawn tiles horizontally instead of isometrically. This was the most challenging part for me I think.After the tiles were set horizontally, I spawned smaller black tiles that would act as the sharp keys. Once those were rendered, I had to change the tile clicking function to play a sound everytime. To do this, I downloaded piano keys from archive.org/details/24-piano-keys/ and then I was able to use those as a sampler for tone.js  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I told myself that if we got an extension, I would work with the tone.js and make a piano. I spent most of my time on this, since it was a struggle to figure out the engine code so that I could make the piano go horizontally instead of isometrically diagonal. I think that I spent way too long trying to figure that out, and also the spawning of the black keys was rough. I was able to get the keys spawning on the right side, matching the piano pattern, but the left side did not work, so I decided to get rid of the left side entirely and on scroll infinity one way. Other than than, I think that this piano was kind of hard to code because of the way that enginejs was configured, but I think it ended up pretty well. I was not able to get the keys to play in ascending order, but I tried to add my own fix by lowering the octave. </p>

				<h2>Artistic Statemnt</h2>
				<p>
					Infinity:
					This world is vast ocean with islands scattered around. This extends into infinity in all directions. 
				Variation in Space:
					The water have a deeper and darker blue to indicate depth. The islands have palm trees and autotiling implemented
				Variation in Key:
					The world key determines the islands that spawn, and the water depth, it is used to control the noise
				Signs of Life:
					Clicking on the water will create a ripple in the water
