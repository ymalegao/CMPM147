			<h1>Experiment 1 - Getting Started</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<button id="clicker">Generate Tweet</button>
				<div
				style="
					font-family: fantasy;
					border: thin solid gray;
					padding: 1em;
					margin: 1em;
					box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px gray;

				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this generator, I am trying to generate how modern tweets by politians look like,
					except done in the context of the founding fathers. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Based on the template that was provided, all I really had to do was to brainstorm of a theme
					for what I wanted the generator to do. Once that was done, I had to change the template for the 
					generator, and then think of the filler words that would used in the template. 
					After the imitation of the innovation part was over, I had to get the code on glitch to
					the index.html of experiment 1. This part included changing the div of the html to include the button, 
					as well as changing the main function to include the code of the template and the filler words.
					Once this was done, I had to change the glitch code to use jQuery instead of how it simplies the DOM elements
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I decided that it would be fun to have tweets from presidents
					but it would be even funnier if the tweets were in the context of the founding fathers.
					I think the overall outcome of the tweets are quite funny, especially since it sounds like a modern
					tweet, but the people in the messsage are the founding fathers and their enemies. I think the most difficult part of This
					experiment was the transfer of the code from glitch to the index.html of experiment 1. I am not used to working with html 
					so I had to make sure that the changes that I was making were in the right spots, since if I accidently put it before
					a div or after a div, the code would not work. I think the most successful part of this experiment was the outcome of the tweets, 
					and integrating it onto the website.
